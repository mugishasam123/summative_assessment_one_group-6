Creating a single web page that includes a form with multiple input fields, applying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and build the form. A key part of the assignment is to implement input validation and sanitization using JavaScript regular expressions to ensure data integrity and security.

This project will give us hands-on experience in:

    1.Structuring web pages with HTML
    2.Styling the HTML page and enhancing the user experience with CSS
    3.Implementing client-side form validation with JavaScript and using regular expressions for input validation and sanitization

Assignment Overview: We have been assigned one of the following project variations to work on. Each variation requires us to create a form for a different purpose, with specific input fields and validation rules. The goal is to ensure that all user inputs are valid before the form is submitted.
